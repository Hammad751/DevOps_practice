# DevOps Introduction

This lecture outlines the fundamental paradigm shift from traditional software development methodologies to DevOps, highlighting the roles of development and operations teams, the limitations of the Waterfall model, and the agility offered by modern CI/CD pipelines.

## 👥 Core Roles & Responsibilities

### 1. Development (Dev) Team
* **Primary Focus:** Building the application and engineering features.
* **Responsibility:** Writing source code strictly aligned with the functional specifications and instructions detailed in the project requirements documentation.

### 2. IT Operations (Ops) Team
* **Primary Focus:** Infrastructure Management & Quality Assurance.
* **Responsibility:** Handling product testing, executing production deployments, configuring environments, and maintaining application availability and uptime.

## ⚠️ The Traditional Bottleneck: The Waterfall Model

In a classic Waterfall framework, teams operate in isolated silos, which inherently introduces deployment latencies due to communication gaps and late-stage bug discoveries.

### Linear Progression of Waterfall:
1. **Requirement Planning:** Comprehensive planning based on upfront project specifications.
2. **Code Development:** The development team builds the codebase according to requirements.
3. **Sequential Testing:** Quality assurance and testing are initiated *only* after the entire code development cycle is fully completed.
4. **Heavyweight Configuration:** Post-testing requires a massive amount of manual configuration, environment setting, and infrastructure prep, consuming critical operational time.
5. **The Friction Loop:** If the IT operations team encounters a bug or environment mismatch during deployment, the artifact is routed back to the development team, restarting the cycle and significantly delaying time-to-market.

## ⚡ The Modern Solution: Agile & DevOps

To bypass infrastructure delays and fast-track code delivery across multiple environments, organizations transition toward **Agile methodologies** and **DevOps principles**.

* **Automated Testing:** Replaces manual QA processes with automated test suites, enabling rapid, reliable feedback loops.
* **Continuous Collaboration:** Mitigates miscommunication by integrating development and operational workflows into a shared lifecycle.
* **The DevOps Core:** The fundamental engine driving this agility is the implementation of automated **CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) pipelines**, ensuring seamless transition from code commit to production-ready deployment.
